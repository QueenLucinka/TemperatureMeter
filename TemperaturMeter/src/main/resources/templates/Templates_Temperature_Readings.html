<!--
Thymeleaf Syntax (th:...):
  th:each: This is a Thymeleaf directive that iterates over the readings collection (passed from the controller)
  and dynamically creates table rows for each item.
  th:text: Replaces the text inside the table cells with dynamic data from each TemperatureReading object (ID, temperature, and timestamp).

Table Structure:
  The table has three columns: ID, Temperature (°C), and Timestamp.
  Each row in the table corresponds to one temperature reading, with dynamic data rendered for each column.

Inline CSS:
  The table, th, and td styles are defined to make the table responsive, with borders, padding,
  and background color for headers. This style could be moved to an external CSS file for better separation of concerns.

Dynamic Data:
  The Thymeleaf template expects a List<TemperatureReading> object passed from the backend under the variable name ${readings}.
  The ID, temperature, and timestamp of each TemperatureReading are displayed in their respective columns.
