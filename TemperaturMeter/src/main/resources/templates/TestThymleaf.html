<!-- A heading (h1) element where the content is dynamically replaced by the value of the 'message' variable
     passed from the backend using Thymeleaf.
     'th:text' dynamically injects the 'message' variable, so the content of the h1 tag will display this message.
     If Thymeleaf is not active, the content will be empty. -->

<!--
Thymeleaf Syntax (th:text):
  th:text="${message}" is a Thymeleaf expression that replaces the inner content of the <h1> element with
  the value of the message variable passed from the backend.
  If message is not available, the heading will remain empty.

Static Page Title:
  The page's title is set to a static string, "Test Thymeleaf", which appears in the browser tab.

Dynamic Content:
The message variable is expected to be passed from the server-side (likely from a Spring controller)
and will be displayed inside the <h1> element.
