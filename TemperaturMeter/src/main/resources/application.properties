spring.application.name=TemperaturMeter
# Sets the name of the Spring Boot application.

# MySQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Tempdata
# Defines the JDBC URL to connect to the MySQL database.
# "Tempdata" is the name of the database, and it's hosted locally on port 3306.

spring.datasource.username=user
# Specifies the username to connect to the MySQL database. Replace "user" with your actual MySQL username.

spring.datasource.password=password
# Specifies the password for the database user. Replace "password" with the actual password for the MySQL user.

spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
# Defines the driver class to be used for the MySQL connection.
# This uses the MySQL Connector/J driver for Java (the standard driver class for MySQL).

# Enable Hibernate DDL auto (to automatically create/modify the schema based on entities)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
# Hibernate will automatically update the database schema based on the JPA entities.
# This means any changes in the entity classes will be reflected in the database schema.

# Show SQL queries in the console (for debugging)
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
# Enables logging of SQL statements executed by Hibernate in the console. Useful for debugging.

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
# Formats the SQL queries to make them more readable in the console. This makes the SQL output easier to understand.

spring.jpa.open-in-view=false
# Disables the "Open Session in View" pattern, which keeps the Hibernate session open during web request processing.
# This helps avoid certain performance and memory issues when working with long-running web requests.

# Serial Communication Configuration
serial.port=COM6
# Specifies the serial port to be used for communication with external devices (such as an Arduino).
# In this case, COM6 is the port name on a Windows system.

serial.baudrate=9600
# Specifies the baud rate (speed of data transmission) for the serial communication.
# Here, it's set to 9600, which is a common baud rate for many serial communication devices.

# Thymeleaf cache
spring.thymeleaf.prefix=classpath:/templates/
# Specifies the directory where Thymeleaf templates are located.
# 'classpath:/templates/' means the templates are located inside the 'templates' folder in the classpath.

spring.thymeleaf.suffix=.html
# Defines the file extension for Thymeleaf templates, so Thymeleaf will look for files ending with '.html'.

spring.thymeleaf.cache=false
# Disables the Thymeleaf cache, which ensures that any changes made to templates are reflected immediately without restarting the application.
# This is useful during development but should be enabled in production to improve performance.
